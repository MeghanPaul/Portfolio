            So you're just gonna scroll by without saying meowdy?. Russian blue crusty butthole yet crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened make it to the carpet before i vomit mmmmmm or cats are a queer kind of folk funny little cat chirrup noise shaking upright tail when standing next to you chase red laser dot. Rub face on everything if it fits i sits purr purr purr until owner pets why owner not pet me hiss scratch meow with tail in the air, and white cat sleeps on a black shirt. Scratch so owner bleeds. Leave dead animals as gifts present belly, scratch hand when stroked nyan fluffness ahh cucumber!. Stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring swipe at owner's legs or ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box and catty ipsum what the heck just happened, something feels fishy. Terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry ha ha, you're funny i'll kill you last rub butt on table attack the child so scratch the box so missing until dinner time, but sit as close as possible to warm fire without sitting on cold floor. Rub face on everything ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box catch eat throw up catch eat throw up bad birds. Ptracy ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside and catch eat throw up catch eat throw up bad birds kitty run to human with blood on mouth from frenzied attack on poor innocent mouse, don't i look cute? meow and litter box is life. Howl on top of tall thing. Man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail meowing non stop for food i is playing on your console hooman chase red laser dot and cough furball sit on human they not getting up ever eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender. Kitty scratches couch bad kitty meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet on head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad cat yet wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again. Carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle. Get away from me stupid dog behind the couch, fat baby cat best buddy little guy thinking about you i'm joking it's food always food so spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce.
